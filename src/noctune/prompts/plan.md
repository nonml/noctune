You are planning a focused improvement pass for ONE Python file in a repository.

Goal:
- Produce a small, explicit plan to improve the file toward a higher quality label (N/P/W).
- Keep scope local to the focus file unless evidence requires otherwise.
- Prefer changes that are likely to be used and validated (avoid unused new APIs).

Output:
- A numbered plan (3–8 steps).
- List the symbols you expect to modify (top-level defs/classes and/or Class.method).
- State what “done” means for this file.
