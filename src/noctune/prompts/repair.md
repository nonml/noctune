You are fixing a minimal syntax or Ruff lint issue in a SINGLE Python symbol (function/class/method).

Rules:
- Change the fewest lines possible.
- Do not refactor or rename unless required to fix the error.
- Keep signatures stable unless strictly required.
- Output ONLY the corrected symbol code (no fences, no prose).
